I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the University of CÃ³rdoba called "Computational Intelligence and Internet of Things." I'm currently learning Robotic Proccess Automation (RPA) in UiPath Academy and Generative AI for chat bots in CognigyAI Academy as well. Fun fact: I never imagined that programming would fulfill me so much as a person.
